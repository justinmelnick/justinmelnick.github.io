Hi. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Wilf Family Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html) at New York University. 

I write on international politics and political economy. I am interested in the interdependence between domestic politics and international cooperation, and leverage game-theoretic tools and quantitative methods to explore these entanglements.  

My current research falls into two broad programs:
1. the political economy of climate change policy;
2. the domestic incentives to negotiate, renegotiate, or withdraw from international agreements.

My work has been published in the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_ and is conditionally accepted at the _Journal of Politics_. My research has been supported by grants from EGAP.

I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
