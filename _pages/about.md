Hi. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Wilf Family Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html) at New York University. I am also an inaugural NYU Climate Doctoral Fellow with [NYU's Climate Initiative](https://www.nyu.edu/academics/interdisciplinary-initiatives/climate.html). I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market.

I write on international politics and political economy, with a methodological emphasis on game-theoretic and causal inference tools. My current research focuses on the political economy of climate change.

<!-- In particular, I study the role of information and uncertainty in leadersâ€™ incentives to supply global public goods as well as the effects of domestic politics on international relations, each with applications to climate change cooperation.

 . I am particularly interested in studying the domestic politics of international cooperation and developing theories about the roles of information and uncertainty in climate politics.

I am interested in the interdependence between domestic politics and international cooperation, and explore these entanglements by leveraging game-theoretic tools and quantitative methods.

My current research falls into two broad programs:
1. the political economy of climate change policy;
2. the domestic incentives to negotiate, renegotiate, or withdraw from international agreements. -->

My work has been published or is forthcoming in _International Organization_, the _Journal of Politics_, the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_, the _Journal of Theoretical Politics_, and the _Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy_. My research has been supported by grants from EGAP.

I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
