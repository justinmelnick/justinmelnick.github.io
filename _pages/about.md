Welcome. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Wilf Family Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html) at New York University. 

I write on international politics and political economy. I am particularly interested in the domestic institutional factors that drive international outcomes, and vice versa. My current reserach focuses on how electoral incentives affect the negotiation of or withdrawal from international agreements and on the political economy of climate change. Methodologically, I primarily leverage game-theoretic tools, but am also interested in reduced-form causal approaches and structural estimation. 

My work has been published in the _Journal of Conflict Resolution._

I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
