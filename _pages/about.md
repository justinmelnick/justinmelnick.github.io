Welcome. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Wilf Family Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html) at New York University. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and domestic politics. I focus on how electoral incentives drive foreign policy choices and on the political economy of climate change, primarily using game-theoretic tools. My research has been published in the _Journal of Conflict Resolution._
